This is a STAT 331 Final Project that analyzes datasets from Gapminder. The datasets include life expectancy and carbon dioxide emissions per capita from multiple countries over various years. The project works to understand whether there is a linear relationship between carbon dioxide emissions per capita and life expectancy, as well as if our predicted model is a good fit for the data.
